    # Adding -Oz to Xcode generator makes it place to OTHER_CPLUSPLUSFLAGS property, which is always
    # appended to the clang command line *after* GCC_OPTIMIZATION_LEVEL. Since officially only Xcode 11
    # will get full support for -Oz within GCC_OPTIMIZATION_LEVEL property, we first need to wait for
    # a version of CMake that will detect -Oz flag and place it correctly into the GCC_OPTIMIZATION_LEVEL
    # property. By putting it to OTHER_CPLUSPLUSFLAGS it is not possible to override -Oz with -O3 or -Ofast
    # for certain projects, as this flag is correctly placed into GCC_OPTIMIZATION_LEVEL which Xcode puts
    # *before* OTHER_CPLUSPLUSFLAGS property during clang command line invocation.
    # This is tested with both Xcode 10.2 and Xcode 11.0 beta using CMake 3.14.5.
